# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Requirements

Given a starter code, including an HTML and CSS file, we were to build a pixel art maker using JavaScript.

The code should let the user create a grid of squares by choosing height and width of the grid (within reason) and then filling in any squares that were clicked with a colour chosen from the colour picker (already included in the HTML).

The user should also be able to reset the grid to an "empty" state by clicking on the same "submit" button used for submitting height and width preferences.
